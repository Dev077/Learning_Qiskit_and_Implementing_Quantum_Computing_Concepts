# Quantum Arithmetic Circuits
- Developed quantum adder circuits using CNOT and Toffoli (CCX) gates to perform binary addition on 4-qubit systems
- Implemented and tested quantum logic gates (XOR operations) for all input combinations (00, 01, 10, 11) with verification through measurement histograms
- Investigated superposition-based quantum arithmetic by applying Hadamard gates to input qubits
