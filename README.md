### Quantum Fourier Transform Implementation
- Built 2-qubit Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT) circuits using controlled-phase rotations and SWAP gates
- Visualized quantum state transformations on the Bloch sphere to validate QFT circuit behavior and phase relationships
- Analyzed statevector outputs to verify correct frequency domain transformations




### Quantum Arithmetic Circuits
- Developed quantum adder circuits using CNOT and Toffoli (CCX) gates to perform binary addition on 4-qubit systems
- Implemented and tested quantum logic gates (XOR operations) for all input combinations (00, 01, 10, 11) with verification through measurement histograms
- Investigated superposition-based quantum arithmetic by applying Hadamard gates to input qubits
