# Quantum Fourier Transform Implementation
- Built 2-qubit Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT) circuits using controlled-phase rotations and SWAP gates
- Visualized quantum state transformations on the Bloch sphere to validate QFT circuit behavior and phase relationships
- Analyzed statevector outputs to verify correct frequency domain transformations
