# Quantum Circuit Development & Simulation

>Designed and implemented quantum circuits using Qiskit framework with Python, including single and multi-qubit operations (X, H, RY, Phase gates)

>Simulated quantum systems using AerSimulator with up to 10,000 shots to analyze quantum state behavior and measurement outcomes

>Visualized quantum states and measurement results through histograms and Bloch sphere representations for circuit validation
